        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

        <p>The word <em>emphasis</em> is emphasized in this sentence.</p>

        <p>The word <strong>strong</strong> is strongly emphasized in this sentence.</p>

        <p>The last word in this sentence has the emphasis found in the first sentence
            as well as in the second <em><strong>sentence</strong></em>.</p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

        <p>There is a soft line break after this sentence.<br/>
            There is antoher soft line break after this sentence.<br/> 
            There is hard line break instead of a soft line break after this sentence.</p>
